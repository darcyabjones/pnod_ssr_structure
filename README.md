The following scripts were used to analyse a data set of 28 SSR markers on 155 Australian Parastagonospora nodorum isolates, a necrotrophic pathogen of wheat, and generate Tables and Figures published in our paper "Periodic Pyrrhic victories define the septoria nodorum blotch interaction". The study is about: 1) population genetic structure of the isolates; 2) their effectors profiles; 3) and their implication in Australian breeding programs.

Different steps were involved in the process including:
1. Testing marker's suitability 
2. Examining the power of effectively identify each individual in the collection
3. Building phylogenetic trees with 22 P. nodorum overseas isolates and six outliners (other species)
4. PCA analysis to look for patterns
5. Measuring genetics diversity of the whole population, each group or each marker
6. Un-supervised clustering method (snapclust)
7. Supervised groupping technique (DAPC)
8. AMOVA for partitioning genetics diversity
9. Measuring genetics distence between groups
10. Constructing effector networks of ToxA, Tox1 and Tox3


Please note only Figures/Tables which were created in R are reported here.
